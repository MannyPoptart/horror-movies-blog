> Review: In 2019, in a dystopian futuristic version of Tokyo now known as Neo-Tokyo, we meet the protagonist, Shōtarō Kaneda, and his best friend and antagonist, Tetsuo Shima. One day, Kaneda and his biker gang are chased by the rival gang known as The Clowns, which ends in a crash involving Tetsuo. Tetsuo survives the crash, and what unravels is the truth surrounding "Akira" and its connection to Tetsuo's new telekinetic powers. This film was the catalyst to inspire many future anime, manga, and films. Many will recognize Kaneda's famous bike slide scene referenced in many different medias still to this day. What makes this movie stand out is the dedication the artists took to create the movie's scenes as the movie runs at 24 frames per second, making it really smooth and beautiful.

> Rating: 11/10
