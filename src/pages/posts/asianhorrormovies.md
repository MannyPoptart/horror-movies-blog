- ### Pulse (Kairo 2001)

> Review: Taking place in Tokyo, Japan. Pulse is a relentlessly depressive film from beginning to end. It depicts the main characters discovering spirits are trying to communicate with the real world through the internet. Each main character experiences their own depressive downfall as they try to figure out what the ghosts are trying to tell them. This film, though depressing, does a great job at keeping each character's plot unique and intriguing, it was creative for the time it was released at and is still a movie worth watching.

> Rating: 9.5/10

> Review: Oldboy begins with the main character, Oh Dae-su, in a drunk state being obnoxious and waiting for his friend at the police station after being arrested. Oh Dae-su is then mysteriously imprisoned for 15 years in a sealed hotel room only to be fed the same food every day, and keeping a tv as the only form of entertainment. One day, he is freed, but he is given clues to find who kept him prisoner for so long, and their reason for choosing Oh Dae-su. This film is timeless and has a thrilling story with a horrific ending, from beginning to end this movie is worth watching especially its one-shot corridor fight scene and ending, truly an influential movie.

> Rating: 10/10

## Chinese Horror Movies

- ### Dumplings (2004)

> Review: In Dumplings, we meet Mrs. Li who is a wealthy actress worried about losing her youthful appearance. She makes an effort to privately meet Aunt Mei who is a local chef that makes dumplings which supposedly maintain a person's youth. As Mrs. Li continues to eat the dumplings, she becomes more and more curious as to what exactly Aunt Mei is using for the filling. This film is great because it does not use cheap jumpscares and does not hold back on its horrific reveals as the story progresses.
