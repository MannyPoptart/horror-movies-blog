> Review: This movie starts with main character OJ and his father observing the sky at their farm as objects randomly start falling. However, the objects fall so fast that it kills OJ's father. After a time skip, we then see OJ and his sister discover strange things happening at the farm leading to some of their horses to go missing. OJ has a close encounter with a "UFO" and he decides to have a surveillance system installed so that he can make money with his sister by selling the footage, but things don't work out as intended. This movie is amazing at building suspense for the big reveal of the UFO, and the story flows in different parts which all connect back to the main story. I was in awe at the fresh approach with the UFO in this film and was completely shocked at how brutal and scary many scenes were with the UFO.

> Rating: 9/10
